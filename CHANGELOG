## Version 1.7.0

### New Features
- Heroic now will continue the download status from where it stopped instead of getting back from 0% everytime.
- Added option to enable Nvidia Prime Render Offload on settings
- Added a Wiki button to NavBar

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an old bug where big installations could be interrupted #195
- Fixed another old bug where Heroic wasn't finding Steam Proton on Ubuntu and derivatives #359
- Fixed missing Unreal Marketplace Assets introduced on 1.6.1 #367

### Other Stuff

- Removed some other dependencies that might give some better performance overall as well.
